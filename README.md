# Vaccine-Hesitancy
CSE445 Project Machine Learning

COVID-19 pandemic caused lots of losses, both human and economic. To bring the amount of COVID cases down vaccination of populations is crutial. One of the problems when it comes to vaccinating people, is that many are hesitant to get vaccinated for various reasons. So if we could predict those who might be hesitant to get vaccinated, then there could be an effort made to help reduce hesitancy. Our paper aims to do just that. We created a predictive model that takes advantage of data from previous work where they collected data from volunteers regarding how they percieve their health care system and vaccination in general. By using a machine learning model to predict whether a user is hesitant to get vaccinated or not, we can identify the ones that may be hesitant automatically.
